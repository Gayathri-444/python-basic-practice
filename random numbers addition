#problem 15 : Imagine you have two randomly chosen numbers, and your goal is to write a program that adds them together. How will you set up your program to generate these numbers and calculate their sum?

import random 

# from numbers 1-200 the numbers will generate randomly
n1 = random.randint(1,200)
n2 = random.randint(1,200)
add = n1 + n2 # sum of the 2 random numbers

print(add)
