#problem 8: Write a program that reads a number N and counts how many zeroes are in the number. Print Count of even digits is greater than two if there are more than two even digits in the given number. Otherwise, print Count of even digits is not greater than two.

n = input() #a integer input from user
count = 0 #intialising a variable to zero

for i in n: #iterating through the for loop
    if i=="0": #checking through if condition , equal to zero
        count = count + 1 #adding the count of zeroes to the count variable

        
if count > 3: #checking if count of zereos is greater than 3
    print("Count of zeroes is greater than three")
else: # else condition, count of zeroes not greater than 3
    print("Count of zeroes is not greater than three")
