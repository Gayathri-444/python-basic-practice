#problem 2 : write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks if the square root of A is equal to B.

# taking two inputs from user A and B
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
# assigning a varaiable a, such that the input A to the power of 0.5 (that is sqaure root (1/2))
a = int(A**0.5)
#under if-else loop 
if a==B: # if condition checks whether the a is equal to the value of B 
    print("Square root of A is equal to B")
else: # else condition works, if condition is false
    print("Square root of A is not equal to B")
