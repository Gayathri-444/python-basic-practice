#problem 11: Write a function with name sum_of_squares_m_to_n that takes two integers (M and N) and sum the squares from M to N.

def sum_of_squares_m_to_n(m, n):
    s=0
    for i in range(m,n+1): #iterating the loop from M to N+1 
        pow = i**2  #finding the power of each number
        s = s + pow # adding the powers
    print(s)
        

m = int(input())
n = int(input())

sum = sum_of_squares_m_to_n(m, n) #function calling
