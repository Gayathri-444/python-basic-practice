#problem 6: Write a program that reads two numbers N and T and prints the count of numbers from 1 to N that are divisible by T.

#two inputs n and t
n = int(input())
t = int(input())
count = 0 # count variable intially as zero
for i in range(1,n+1): #iterating through the numbers from 1 to n
    if i%t==0: # through if condition checking whether the number is divisible by t
        count = count + 1 #counting the number of divisible numbers
print(count) #printing the count of numbers
