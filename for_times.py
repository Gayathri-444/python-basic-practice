'''problem :Imagine you need to repeat a cheerful message. Write a program that uses a for 
loop to print "ALL IS WELL" exactly twenty times. How will you set up your loop to 
ensure this message appears the right number of times?'''


for i in range(1,20): #starting from 0-20 , so it exactly prints 20 times.
    print("ALL IS WELL")  #if starting from 1, it will print less than 1 time.
