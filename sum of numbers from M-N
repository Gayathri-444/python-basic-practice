#problem 5: Given two integers M and N,write a program to print the sum of the numbers from M to N.

#two inputs M,N
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
sum = 0 #initialising the sum equal to zero
for i in range(m,n+1): #iterating the loop through m to n
  sum = sum + i    #finding the sum of the numbers
print(sum)      #printing the sum
