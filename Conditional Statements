#problem 13: Write a Python program that:
Takes three numbers as input from the user.
Use conditional statements to check which number is the largest among the three.
Check if the largest number is even or odd using an operator.
Print the largest number and whether it is even or odd.

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

# if loops to find the largest number
if a > b and a > c:
    largest = a
elif b > a and b > c:
    largest = b
else:
    largest = c

# Check if the largest number is even or odd
if largest % 2 == 0:
    e = "even"
else:
    e = "odd"

print("The largest number is", largest)
print(str(largest) + " is " + e)
