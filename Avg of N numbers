#problem 4: Write a program that reads a numnber N and prints the average of N numbers from 1.

n = int(input()) #user input
sum = 0 # intialising a varaible value equal to zero 
for i in range(n+1): #iterating the numbers through for loop, till the N numbers
  sum = sum + i   # sum of the numbers from 1 to n 
avg = sum/n   #finding avg 
print(avg)    #printing the average
